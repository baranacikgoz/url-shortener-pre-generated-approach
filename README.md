# url-shortener-pre-generated-approach
This URL shortener service is designed with a unique approach: instead of generating shortened URLs on-the-fly when requested, it pre-generates a pool of unique shortened URLs in the background. This ensures immediate availability and eliminates the need for repeated database checks for uniqueness during the URL shortening process.
